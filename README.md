- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MKainbacher

I'm a german software developer.
My main development field is frontend development (mainly web), but I'm also working with serverless backend solutions (mainly Azure functions).
Also, I'm digging into game development.

Working with:
- Angular
- Flutter (currently learning)
- .NET (C# in particular)
- Unity3D
- Azure
